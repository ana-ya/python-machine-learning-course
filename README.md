# Introduction to machine learning
The course is basic course, read by teachers of the Higher school of Economics on [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/learn/vvedenie-mashinnoe-obuchenie)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To install Python projects, youâ€™ll need to install Anaconda 3.7 or Miniconda 3:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) - is the easiest way to do Python data science and machine learning. It includes hundreds of popular data science packages and the conda package and virtual environment manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
* [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) - is a mini version of Anaconda that includes only conda and its dependencies.

### Installing

A step by step instructions for get project and start development

Clone the repository and execute the scripts in your IDEA (PyCharm /VScode / Spyder):

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ana-ya/python-machine-learning-course.git
$ cd python-machine-learning-course
```

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - is a programming language
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) - working with arrays and matrices.
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - processing of the datasets
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - data visualization
